Emerging literature suggests unique roles of white matter in supporting general cognition and differentiating crystallized and fluid intelligence (GÃ³ngora et al., 2020; Penke et al., 2012; Simpson-Kent et al., 2020). Of note, age 9-10 represents a critical change point for the relationship between white matter and crystallized intelligence (Simpson Kent et al., 2020). Thus far, however, no study has specified the
role of structural connectivity (SC) in crystallized intelligence of adolescents. We can analyze SCs of subjects in ABCD with high vs. low crystallized intelligence by establishing a model, aiming at learning interpretable SC-based brain connectome maps that can differentiate the levels of crystallized intelligence.
