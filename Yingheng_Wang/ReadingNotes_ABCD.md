# Understanding the ABCD dataset.

## Main goal
To track the brain development from childhood through adolescence to understand biological and environmental factors that can affect the brain’s developmental trajectory.

## Sampling stage

The ABCD Study has completed recruitment for the baseline study
sample (N = 11,875; youth = 9–10-years-old; 47.8% female; 52.1%
White, 15.0% Black, 20.3% Hispanic, 2.1% Asian, and 10.5% other
[e.g., biracial]) and will be continuing to follow these youth for at
least ten years.

The ABCD Study has 21 sites that are distributed nationally.

In total, 11,875 children completed the baseline assessment.

In addition to this school-based approach, there are four ABCD
Study sites that recruited samples of monozygotic and dizygotic
twins, resulting in ~860 twin pairs in the baseline sample.

## Brain imaging

Youth participate in a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) session for every 2 years.

This MRI assessment includes measures of brain structure, with
both T1 and T2 weighted imaging and diffusion imaging for
assessment of white mater integrity. 

The MRI assessment also includes 20 min of resting state functional connectivity data and functional MRI during three different task domains. 
These domains were designed to capture brain activity during numerous aspects
of cognition and emotion function in as short a time as possible,
including working memory, response inhibition, anticipation and
receipt of rewards and losses, face processing (both neutral and
emotional), and subsequent memory.
