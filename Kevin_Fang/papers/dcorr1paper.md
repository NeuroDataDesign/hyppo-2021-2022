# Measurring and testing dependeence by correlations of distances

- Distance correlation is a new measure of dependence between random vectors.
- Distance covariance and distance correlation are analogous to product-moment covariance and correlation, but unlike the classical definition of correlation, distance correlation is zero only if the random vectors are independent. 
- The empirical distance dependence measures are based on certain Euclidean distances between sample elements rather than sample moments, yet have a compact representation analogous to the classical covariance and correlation. 
- Implementation of the test and Monte Carlo results are also presented
- Note that distance correlation satisfies 0 <= R <= 1 and R = 0 only if X and Y are independent
