- Why is it not straight forward to generalize distance  correlation to partial distance correlation?
 - One could try to follow the definitions of the classical partial covariance and partial correlation that are based on orthogonal projections in a Euclidean space, but there is a serious difficulty. 
 Orthogonality in case of partial distance covariance and partial distance correlation means independence, but when we compute the orthogonal projection of a random variable onto the condition variable, 
 the "remainder" in the difference is typically not independent of  the condition.
 
 ## not finished need to ask some queestions
